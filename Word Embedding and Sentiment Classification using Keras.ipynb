    "# Feature Extraction\n",
    "***\n",
    "In text processing, words represent discrete, categorical features. How do we encode this categorical data in a way that is ready to be used by the algorithms? One of the simples techniques is the **bag of words** featurization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bag of Words (BOW)\n",
    "***\n",
    "We make a **list of unique words** in the corpus, called the **vocabulary**. Then each word in the vocabulary gets its own basis vector. Then a sentence, or each document in the corpus is represented by a vector that is equal to the vector sums of the basis vectors for the words appearing in that sentence. \n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to the **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)** technique:\n",
    "\n",
    "## TF-IDF\n",
    "***\n",
    "First, let us clarify what is meant by document. A corpus is made up of many documents. So if your corpus is a set of tweets, each document is a tweet. So we can ask for the word vector of an entire tweet. The word vector of an entire tweet would be some function of the word vectors of its constituent words.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{Term Frequency (TF)} = \\frac{\\textrm{number of times token appears in single document}}{\\textrm{number of tokens in single document}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)} = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\textrm{total number documents}}{\\textrm{number of documents this token appears in}}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{TF-IDF} = (\\textrm{TF})(\\textrm{IDF})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of calculating the TF-IDF of a term in a document:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "tweet_one = \"This is a beautiful beautiful day day day day day\"\n",
    "tweet_two = \"This is a beautiful night night\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we would have that:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "TF(\"beautiful\",tweet_one) = 2/10\n",
    "TF(\"day\", tweet_one) = 5/10\n",
    "IDF(\"beautiful\") = log(2/2) = 0\n",
    "IDF(\"day\") = log(2/1) = 0.3\n",
    "\n",
    "TF_IDF(\"beautiful\", tweet_one) = (2/10)(0)=0\n",
    "TF_IDF(\"day\", tweet_one) = (5/10)(0.30) = 0.15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we see that for the first tweet, the TF-IDF method heavily penalizes the word \"beautiful\", but assigns greater weight to \"day\". \"beautiful\" gives no power of resolution because it appears in both documents. \"day\" is an important word for `tweet_one` in the context of the entire corpus (it only appears in one of the two tweets). \n",
    "\n",
    "`scikit-learn` provides efficient tools for computing the TF-IDF of a corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major disadvantages of using the bag of words featurization is that it discards all information contained in the word order of the vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we use an approach called **Word Embedding**\n",
    "## Word Embedding\n",
    "***\n",
    "A word embedding is a numerical representation of text where words that have similar semantic meaning are geometrically closer in their semantic vector space. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Word2Vec\n",
    "***\n",
    "Word2Vec takes a corpus of text and produces a vector space that has the property that vectors that are geometrically close also share common semantic contexts in the corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Glove\n",
    "***\n",
    "The **Global Vectors for Word Representation** algorithm is an extension to the Word2Vec model. GloVe constructs a co-occurrence matrix on the whole text corpus. The entries of this matrix are the probabilities that a given token appears in the common of every other word in the vocabulary. This assumes the **distributional hypothesis**."
